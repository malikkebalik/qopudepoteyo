Directed by Ron Howard, the thriller used<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> tangible sets to create realistic explosions and flames</a> to suit its plot, which – unlike its standout effects – was criticized for not being as well thought out as the flames. The story follows two firefighter brothers who must overcome their own personal rivalry in order to capture a pyromaniac who is creating some spectacularly explosive —and murderous — fires all over Chicago.&nbsp;</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=354 data-current-count=354 data-injectable=false>While the plot might be considered predictably over the top by some (not this author, I love the drama), Backdraft&nbsp;was a legitimate blockbuster, spawning a Universal Studios attraction and a 2019 sequel. It’s obvious it made an impression on audiences, and some of that impact can be attributed to its cast, filled with big names and character actors.</p><p data-characters=204 data-current-count=558 data-injectable=true>A lot can change in 30 years, but many of these actors have continued to carve out celebrated careers in Hollywood long after the success of Backdraft.

Russell has been acting since childhood and hasn’t stopped; one big role after Backdraft was Colonel Jack O’Neil in 1994’s sci-fi classic Stargate. His most critically-acclaimed work would come in 2004 with the sports movie Miracle. Like many big name actors, Russell has found his way into the MCU and starred in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 as Ego, Peter Quill’s Celestial father and the film’s antagonist. Additionally, Russell has become a favorite of Quentin Tarantino’s and has been in several of the director’s films, most recently 2019’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. Russell resides in Canada with his longtime partner, actress Goldie Hawn.</p><h2 id=h-william-baldwin-as-brian-mccaffrey data-injectable=false>William Baldwin as Brian McCaffrey</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Billy Baldwin (@thebillybaldwin)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=800 data-current-count=1100 data-injectable=true>William Baldwin plays the younger of the McCaffrey firefighting brothers, and though inexperienced, he wishes to discover the arsonist’s identity and prove to his sibling he has what it takes to become a firefighter like their late father.

After Backdraft, he enjoyed a number of starring roles in big-budget films like 1993’s Sliver and 1999’s Virus.

He was posthumously credited for his role as Big Bob in 1998’s Pleasantville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnqpmrJiaeqSt0q1kqJ5dl66kt8OrmJ%2BsXaO8uHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhere-s-the-cast-of-backdraft-now.html&text=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20Backdraft%20now%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhere-s-the-cast-of-backdraft-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-s-the-cast-of-backdraft-now.html&title=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20Backdraft%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhere-s-the-cast-of-backdraft-now.html&title=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20Backdraft%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhere-s-the-cast-of-backdraft-now.html&title=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20Backdraft%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhere-s-the-cast-of-backdraft-now.html&description=Wheres%20the%20cast%20of%20Backdraft%20now%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./dylan-barbour-biography-age-height-wife-net-worth-family.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Dylan Barbour Biography, Age, Height, Wife, Net Worth, Family">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./tom-singh-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Tom Singh Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

The musical maestro dished all about the hot new track in an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">exclusive interview with Celeb Secrets</a> at CMA Fest this past summer:</p><p>“This is the song that kept me in Nashville… Nothing was really working out for me in Nashville at that time, and all my friends were getting deals [and] everything was going on, and, you know, I was just wondering, ‘Am I doing the right thing?’ so I sat there on my guitar for about 45 minutes and wrote this song, and I’m hoping that anybody that hears it, it touches them.”</p><p data-characters=164 data-current-count=164 data-injectable=false>Just a few weeks later, HunterGirl took to&nbsp;<a href=#>Instagram</a>&nbsp;to tease “Ain’t About You” to her 185,000 followers as well, prior to its release on August 11:</p><p>“I’m writing this because I want to share a really personal song with y’all. I call this song my 45 minute conversation with Jesus. This song kept me in Nashville two years ago, and little did I know a few weeks later everything would change. This song is about not giving up on your dream, whatever that may be. I think we’re all here to do something special, Let me know if you want to hear it.”</p><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=174 data-injectable=false>Now that the song “Ain’t About You” is out for the world to hear, it looks like HunterGirl will be staying on everyone’s radar until further notice…</p><p data-characters=221 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>The emerging artist has tons of new tunes on the horizon that will prove her to be a force to be reckoned with within the country music scene, many of which she has been teasing during her show-stopping live performances:</p><p>“Being on the road has been awesome. It’s so much fun. Like, all of us in a van going to the shows and like loading the gear in and getting to meet the fans after the shows and having merch… I think just watching [my fans] respond to new songs has been so cool during the sets, and I’m just like, ‘Hey! This is a new song. I know y’all don’t know it,’ and they always hang on the ride… I’m really excited to put some of the songs out that I’ve been playing that are new on the road, and hopefully everybody likes them.”</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=210 data-injectable=false>If you are an American Idol fan and loved watching HunterGirl’s journey on season 20, be sure to connect with the rising country star on social media so you do not miss a single release from here on out.</p><p data-characters=159 data-current-count=369 data-injectable=false>In addition to this, be sure to keep your eyes peeled for an official premiere date for season 22 of American Idol — springtime can’t come soon enough!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedqsCqr46hrKeslae0qr7LZp2rp51irq6x0aKamqZdnrGwuIyhnKtlopqurXnNmqSeZZGcsm6tzZ1ksKCVp7Juv8eeZKKrXaO8uHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhuntergirl-from-american-idol-her-real-name-age-and-where-she-is-now.html&text=HunterGirl%20from%20American%20Idol%3a%20her%20real%20name%2c%20age%2c%20and%20where%20she%20is%20now&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhuntergirl-from-american-idol-her-real-name-age-and-where-she-is-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhuntergirl-from-american-idol-her-real-name-age-and-where-she-is-now.html&title=HunterGirl%20from%20American%20Idol%3a%20her%20real%20name%2c%20age%2c%20and%20where%20she%20is%20now" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhuntergirl-from-american-idol-her-real-name-age-and-where-she-is-now.html&title=HunterGirl%20from%20American%20Idol%3a%20her%20real%20name%2c%20age%2c%20and%20where%20she%20is%20now" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhuntergirl-from-american-idol-her-real-name-age-and-where-she-is-now.html&title=HunterGirl%20from%20American%20Idol%3a%20her%20real%20name%2c%20age%2c%20and%20where%20she%20is%20now" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhuntergirl-from-american-idol-her-real-name-age-and-where-she-is-now.html&description=HunterGirl%20from%20American%20Idol%3a%20her%20real%20name%2c%20age%2c%20and%20where%20she%20is%20now" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./one-piece-episode-1067-exact-release-date-and-time-confirmed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="One Piece episode 1067 exact release date and time, confirmed">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./50-cent-made-a-shocking-revelation-earlier-this-week.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="50 Cent Made A Shocking Revelation Earlier This Week">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

He died from pulmonary and respiratory complications as a result of lung cancer at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

When he was dying, he was making us laugh in hysterics.”</p><p id=par-3_55>“He was literally dying, but he did something or said something that caused my stepmother and me to go into fits of laughter, which is why I ran out,” she continued. “I thought to myself, ‘I don’t want to be standing there in front of this man, my dearly beloved father, who’s dying, and laughing.’”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-4_12>However, looking back, Karen wishes she would have stayed in the room.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_42>“I was telling this story to Howard Storm, who’s a director, and he said, ‘You should have stayed and laughed out loud,’” she said. “‘That’s what comedians live for!’ He was right; I should have just stood there and blasted out laughing.<strong>”</strong></p><h2 id=h-don-knotts-never-lost-his-sense-of-humor-despite-his-difficult-childhood-that-haunted-him>Don Knotts never lost his sense of humor despite his difficult childhood that haunted him</h2><p id=par-6_26>Don’s mother had him when she was 40. His father had schizophrenia and alcoholism, and would reportedly hold a knife to Don’s neck and threaten him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_29>“My dad was very burdened down by all these problems,” said Karen. “He had problems with his father and an older brother who tormented him because they were alcoholics.”</p><p id=par-8_17>Don went to a lot of therapy. He was affected by his childhood for his entire life.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_66>“He was mercurial,” said Karen of her father. “He had a lot of different kinds of moods. He fought a lot of depression and I helped him, or thought I did, because I could see how he had this endless loop of thought that would always lead to a downward spiral. I would try to break through that and was like Pollyanna, pointing out the positives.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_27>Though Karen tried to cheer her dad up (an enormous burden for any child), he eventually found a psychiatrist that helped to heal him quite a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_67>“Of course, I couldn’t do much,” she said. “I was a kid. He got a great psychiatrist named Duke Renniker. Duke was able to help him a lot. By the end, he had overcome everything that was down in his life. I felt really, really proud of him for all the work that he put into being a happy person. And the truth is, he loved people.”</p><p id=par-12_44>And people loved him. Don Knotts delighted audiences for half a century starring in seven TV shows and over 25 films. He won five Emmy Awards for his <a href=#>work on The Andy Griffith Show</a> alone, doing what he did best — making people laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxsLqMpKWorKSoeqWt1KCfrZ2iYrmmrdWeZJ2dkam1o7HDZqOarZede6nAzKVm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fdon-knotts-daughter-left-his-deathbed-so-she-could-laugh.html&text=Don%20Knotts%27%20Daughter%20Left%20His%20Deathbed%20so%20She%20Could%20Laugh&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fdon-knotts-daughter-left-his-deathbed-so-she-could-laugh.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fdon-knotts-daughter-left-his-deathbed-so-she-could-laugh.html&title=Don%20Knotts%27%20Daughter%20Left%20His%20Deathbed%20so%20She%20Could%20Laugh" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fdon-knotts-daughter-left-his-deathbed-so-she-could-laugh.html&title=Don%20Knotts%27%20Daughter%20Left%20His%20Deathbed%20so%20She%20Could%20Laugh" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fdon-knotts-daughter-left-his-deathbed-so-she-could-laugh.html&title=Don%20Knotts%27%20Daughter%20Left%20His%20Deathbed%20so%20She%20Could%20Laugh" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fdon-knotts-daughter-left-his-deathbed-so-she-could-laugh.html&description=Don%20Knotts%27%20Daughter%20Left%20His%20Deathbed%20so%20She%20Could%20Laugh" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ex-bentley-and-bugatti-ceo-seeks-nine-figure-settlement-from-volkswagen-for-transmission-royalties.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ex-Bentley And Bugatti CEO Seeks Nine-Figure Settlement From Volkswagen For Transmission Royalties">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./the-good-the-bad-the-bandanas.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Good, The Bad, &amp;amp; The Bandanas">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

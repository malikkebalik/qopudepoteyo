Sofia rose to fame when she won her first-ever grand slam in the Australian Open 2020 and ever since then she has been improvising her game.</p><p>She played in Wimbledon 2023 where she knocked out 7th-ranked <a href=# rel=noopener>Coco Gauff</a> in the first round. It was her first-ever win against any top 10 players almost after two years and she looks promising to present tough challenges to everyone. She is currently gearing up to face <a href=# rel=noopener>Barbora Krejcikova</a> in the San Diego Open 2023.&nbsp;</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Sofia Kenin was born on November 14, 1998, in Moscow, Russia, to parents Alexander and Svetlana Kenin. Just a few months after her birth, the Kenin family moved to the United States. They settled in New York City with only $298 to their name. Luckily, their relatives stepped in to offer vital support during this challenging time, allowing Sofia to grow up with her sister, Anya.</p><p>Sofia had a strong passion for tennis from a young age, and it became the central focus of her life. Although details about her high school and college education aren’t readily available, her dedication to tennis has always been clear.</p><h3>Sofia Kenin Career</h3><p>Sofia Kenin’s tennis journey took her to the professional level, where she achieved a remarkable ranking of No. 2 in the ITF junior rankings. She began competing in lower-level Grade 4 events on the ITF Junior Circuit when she was just 13 years old in 2012. After securing her first titles in both singles and doubles in 2013, she moved up to the more competitive Grade 1 level.</p><p>Towards the end of that year, she made her Grade A debut at the Orange Bowl, where she reached the semifinals in singles and finished as the runner-up in doubles, partnering with Kaitlyn McCarthy. They were narrowly defeated by Tornado Alicia Black and Naiktha Bains.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u7deccd5c8defc021b4a303f7ebb016e2><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Kevin Huerter Biography</span></a><p>In 2014, Kenin made her junior Grand Slam debut, but she only managed to win a single match while participating in the last three events of the year. Following the US Open, she represented the United States at the Junior Fed Cup alongside CiCi Bellis and Tornado Alicia Black.</p><p>The team performed exceptionally well, winning the competition by defeating Slovakia 3–0 in the final. Kenin remained undefeated in all five of her matches, which were all in doubles. Her breakthrough continued towards the end of the year when she triumphed at the Orange Bowl, defeating Bellis and Ingrid Neel in the final two rounds.</p><h4>Widespread Fame</h4><p>Sofia Kenin stepped into low-level ITF competitions in 2013, securing her first two professional wins at just 14 years old. Her triumph at the USTA junior national title granted her a wildcard, granting her a chance to make her Grand Slam debut at the 2015 US Open. Unfortunately, she lost her first match to Mariana Duque-Mariño.</p><p>The following year marked a turning point for Kenin as she clinched her first two ITF titles. The initial victory came at a $25K event in Wesley Chapel, Florida, followed by another win at a $50K event in Sacramento, California. This second title earned her the US Open Wild Card Challenge win, granting her a wildcard entry into the main draw of the US Open for the second time.</p><p>Although her journey at the US Open ended with a loss in the opening round against Karolína Plíšková, it was her sole WTA Tour-level match of the year. With an improved ranking, Kenin could focus more on the WTA Tour in 2018. She began the year on a high note, reaching her first WTA quarterfinal at the Auckland Open.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u2839164d579dd9c39d3cb79d1f70313b><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Amanda Scarborough Biography</span></a><p>After an early exit in the first round of the Australian Open, Kenin showcased her talent with impressive performances at the Premier Mandatory events in March. Qualifying for the Indian Wells Open, she reached the second round, propelling her into the top 100. Her momentum continued as she advanced to the third round of the Miami Open, causing an upset against No. 11 Daria Kasatkina.</p><h4>Ups & Down</h4><p>After facing defeats in all five of her WTA Tour matches on clay, Sofia Kenin had a breakthrough on grass. She reached her first WTA semifinal at the Mallorca Open, a significant achievement on this surface. Kenin pulled off a notable upset against the favored world No. 6 Caroline Garcia, marking her first professional win against a top-ten player.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing her momentum in the grass-court season, Kenin made her mark at Wimbledon with a second-round appearance. Notably, she secured her debut win at the prestigious event, defeating Maria Sakkari. This series of successes demonstrated her adaptability and growing prowess on different surfaces.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Sofia Kenin Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Sofia Anna Kenin</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>November 14, 1998</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2023)</td><td>24 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Moscow, Russia</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Tennis Player</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Sofia-Kenin-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 7” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 170 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 63 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 139 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>7.5 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Light Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Blue</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Alex Kenin</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>Lena Kenin</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>Anya Kenin</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>None</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>homeschooled</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>University of Miami</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Sofia-Kenin-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Single</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Who is her boyfriend?</td><td>None</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=uc98d47595fed989112f8adf3b6f9d2b3><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Masayoshi Nakatani Biography</span></a><h3>Personal life</h3><p>Sofia isn’t dating anyone and she is single probably.

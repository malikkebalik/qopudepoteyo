She came through three qualification rounds and beat <a href=#>Anne Kremer</a>, <a href=#>Nathalie Dechy</a>, <a href=#>Eleni Daniilidou</a>, <a href=#>Francesca Schiavone</a>, and Michaëlla Krajicek to eventually play the final against Kim Clijsters, to whom she lost in three sets.</p><p>Kanepi represented Estonia in both the women's singles and women's doubles, partnering <a href=#>Maret Ani</a>, at the 2004 Summer Olympics, losing in the first round of both events.</p><p>Her family has always supported her desire to play professional tennis. She reached world number one in the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior rankings before turning professional in 2000.</p><p>1994–2003 Kaia was trained by Tiit Kivistik.

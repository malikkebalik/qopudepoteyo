Joel Embiid was drafted by the NBA's Philadelphia 76ers as the #3 pick in the 2014 draft. He led the NBA in scoring in both the 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons, making him the first center to do so since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000. Embiid was also named the NBA MVP for the 2022-23 season.</p><h2 id=contracts-salary><strong>Contracts and Salary</strong></h2><p>Joel Embiid is one of the highest-paid players in the NBA. In the 2023-2024 season he ranked 10th in terms of salary for the 2023-2024.</p><p>Embiid is currently signed to a four-year, $213 million supermax contract with the Philadelphia 76ers. It is the largest contract in NBA history for a player who has not yet won an MVP award. The contract began in the 2023-2024 season and will run through the 2026-2027 season. In 2023-2024, Embiid will earn a base salary of $47,607,350. His salary will increase each season of the contract, with a player option for the 2026-2027 season. Embiid's contract is fully guaranteed. This means that he will be paid the full amount of the contract regardless of whether he is injured or not.</p><p>Embiid's career earnings through the end of the 2022-2023 season were $147,405,169. He is projected to earn over $261 million over the course of his current contract. If he retires after that contract, he will have earned $400 million during his time in the NBA.</p><p>His rookie contract was a five-year, <a href=#>$147 million max contract that he signed in 2017</a>.</p><h2 id=early-life-high-school><strong>Early Life and High School</strong></h2><p>Joel Embiid was born on March 16, 1994 in YaoundÃ©, Cameroon to Christine and military officer Thomas. He has a younger sister, and had a younger brother who was killed in a car crash in 2014. Growing up, he played soccer and volleyball, and at the age of 15 began playing basketball. At a basketball camp, Embiid was discovered by NBA player and fellow YaoundÃ© native Luc Mbah a Moute, who became his mentor. Embiid subsequently moved to the United States to pursue a professional basketball career. He first attended Montverde Academy in Florida, which was Mbah a Moute's alma mater; after that, he went to the Rock School in Gainesville, Florida. There, Embiid led the school basketball team to a 33-4 record and a state championship title.</p><h2 id=collegiate-career><strong>Collegiate Career</strong></h2><p>A five-star recruit out of high school, Embiid chose to attend the University of Kansas. He spent one year at the school, playing for the Jayhawks basketball team in the 2013-14 season. Over 28 games, Embiid averaged 11.2 points, 8.1 rebounds, and 2.6 blocks per game. He went on to earn Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year honors.</p><h2 id=philadelphia-76ers-2014-2019><strong>Philadelphia 76ers, 2014-2019</strong></h2><p>Forgoing his final three years of college eligibility, Embiid declared for the NBA draft in 2014. After recovering from foot surgery, he was selected by the Philadelphia 76ers with the third overall pick. However, Embiid continued to struggle with his foot after his selection, and consequently missed the entire 2014-15 season. Following another round of surgery in 2015, he missed the entire 2015-16 season, too. Embiid finally made his debut with the 76ers in October of 2016 in the team's first preseason game, a win over the Boston Celtics. At the end of the month, he made his regular-season debut in a loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder. In December, Embiid set a new career high of 33 points in a victory over the Brooklyn Nets. Early the next year, he posted a then-career high of 14 rebounds in a win over the New York Knicks. Embiid's season ended prematurely in late February after he tore his meniscus in his left knee.</p><p>In October of 2017, Embiid signed a five-year contract extension with the 76ers. He went on to have an impressive 2017-18 season, marked by a new career high of 46 points in a victory over the Los Angeles Lakers in November. In January, Embiid was named a starter for the 2018 NBA All-Star Game. The 76ers made it to the playoffs, where Embiid helped the team advance to the second round, ultimately losing to the Celtics. Another playoff appearance followed in 2019, with the 76ers once again falling in the second round, this time to the Toronto Raptors. Embiid battled through illness during the round, which lasted seven games.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-273687 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Joel-Embiid.jpg alt="Joel Embiid net worth" width=594 height=390 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-273687 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=philadelphia-76ers-2019-2023><strong>Philadelphia 76ers, 2019-2023</strong></h2><p>In the 2019-20 season, Embiid scored a new career high of 49 points in a February win over the Atlanta Hawks. Advancing to the playoffs, the 76ers were eliminated in the first round. Embiid began something of a career renaissance the following season. In February of 2021, he posted a double-double with a new career high of 50 points and 17 rebounds in a win over the Chicago Bulls. He finished the regular season with a then-career high of 28.5 points and 10.6 rebounds per game. The 76ers advanced to the playoffs, where they lost in the second round to the Hawks despite Embiid's impressive averages of 30.4 points and 12.7 rebounds per game. Embiid performed even better in the 2021-22 season after signing a four-year contract extension with the 76ers. In January, he matched his then-career high of 50 points in a victory over the Orlando Magic. Finishing the season, Embiid was named the NBA scoring champion with 30.6 points per game, making him the first center to earn such honors since Shaquille O'Neal in 2000. The 76ers went on to make it to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they lost to the Miami Heat.</p><p>Embiid had his best season yet in 2022-23. In November, he scored a new career high of 59 points in a win over the Utah Jazz. He subsequently earned Eastern Conference Player of the Month honors for both December and January. In February, Embiid reached 10,000 career points, making him the fastest player to do so in 76ers history. He finished the regular season as the NBA scoring champion for the second year in a row, with an average of 33.1 points per game. Embiid was later named the NBA MVP, making him the fifth 76er in history to win that honor. The 76ers subsequently advanced to the playoffs and to the Eastern Conference Semifinals, where they fell to the Celtics in seven games. In the series, Embiid tied <a href=# title="Wilt Chamberlain Net Worth">Wilt Chamberlain</a> for the most 30-point and 10-rebound playoff games in 76ers history.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>In 2018, Embiid began dating Brazilian model Anne de Paula. Two years later, they had a son; he was named Arthur in honor of Embiid's late brother.</p><p>Embiid is a Catholic teetotaler. He is a fan of Real Madrid CF, and frequently posts on social media. Embiid has also worked to combat homelessness in Philadelphia.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNku6OtjqOmnqRdmrqjtcidZKedpGLEsL7ToWY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjoel-embiid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Joel%20Embiid%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjoel-embiid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjoel-embiid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Joel%20Embiid%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjoel-embiid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Joel%20Embiid%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjoel-embiid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Joel%20Embiid%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjoel-embiid-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Joel%20Embiid%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-donate-500k-to-california-wildfire-relief.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kanye West And Kim Kardashian Donate $500K To California Wildfire Relief">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./james-ellroy-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Ellroy Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

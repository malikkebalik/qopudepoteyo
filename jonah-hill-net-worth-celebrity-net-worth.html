Jonah Hill is known for starring in films such as "Superbad," "Knocked Up," "Forgetting Sarah Marshall," "21 Jump Street," "The Wolf of Wall Street," "War Dogs," and "Moneyball."</p><p>Jonah first gained notice by performing in productions that he wrote for himself in the East Village in New York, while he was studying music at the New School. Though he had not considered a career in acting before, the success of his shows led him to shift his focus. After being invited to audition for "I Heart Huckabees" by Dustin Hoffman, he was on his way. He was subsequently "adopted" by prolific filmmaker <a href=# title="Judd Apatow Net Worth">Judd Apatow</a>, and has since appeared in "The 40-Year Old Virgin", "Superbad", and "Knocked Up".&nbsp; He has also appeared in such films as, "Evan Almighty", "Forgetting Sarah Marshall", "Night at the Museum 2", "Bruno", and "Get Him to the Greek".&nbsp; He regularly does voice over work, and has voiced characters for such films as "Horton Hears a Who!", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "Megamind". In 2011, he received widespread critical acclaim, and an Oscar nomination, for his performance as Peter Brand in "Moneyball". Since then he has co-starred in "21 Jump Street",&nbsp; "Django Unchained", "This is the End", "The Wolf of Wall Street", "How to Train Your Dragon 2", and "True Story", among others.</p><h2 id=real-estate><strong>Real Estate</strong></h2><p>In 2010 Jonah bought a home in Los Angeles for a bit below $2 million. He sold this house in 2015 for $3.65 million. Around the same time as the sale, Jonah spent $9.2 million on a loft in the NoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. In March 2022 Jonah listed the NoHo loft for $11 million. He found a buyer a few months later for $10.6 million.</p><p>In September 2019 Jonah spent $6.8 million on a home in Santa Monica, California. He sold this home in October 2021 for $7.2 million.</p><p>In May 2021 Jonah paid $9 million for a home within the gated Malibu Colony. The sellers of this home were Richard and and Laurie Stark, the founders/owners of the hugely-successful Chrome Hearts retail brand. In an unusual coincidence, back in September 2019 the seller of his Santa Monica home was Richard and Laurie's daughter. Jonah sold this home in December 2022 for $11.1 million after having listed it for $15 million in June of 2022. The same month of his sale, Jonah paid $15.5 million for an oceanfront home in the Malibu Colony, right across the street from his former place.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Jonah Hill Feldstein was born on December 20, 1983, in Los Angeles, California. His mother, Sharon Lyn, is a costume designer and his dad, Richard Feldstein, is an entertainment industry accountant who worked with bands like Guns N' Roses.

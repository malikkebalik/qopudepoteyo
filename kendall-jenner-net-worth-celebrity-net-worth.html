She graduated from high school in 2014.</p><h2 id=modeling-career><strong>Modeling Career</strong></h2><p>Jenner was signed with Wilhelmina Models in July 2009, when she was 14 years old. Her first modeling job was the "Rocker Babes with a Twist" campaign for Forever 21 in December 2009 and January 2010. In April 2010, Jenner was featured in Teen Vogue, and in September 2011 she walked for designer Sherri Hill during Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week.

Kendall can earn hundreds of thousands of dollars to do a single Instagram sponsored post.

She tried to sell that condo in June 2017 for $1.6 million but eventually had to lower the price to $1.5 million to find a buyer. In 2017, Kendall sold her Hollywood Hills home for $6.85 million. She gained around $350,000 from the sale after buying in 2016 from actors <a href=# title="John Krasinski Net Worth">John Krasinski</a> and <a href=# title="Emily Blunt Net Worth">Emily Blunt</a>. <a href=# title="Jimmy Kimmel Net Worth">Jimmy Kimmel</a> lived directly across the street. Blunt and Krasinski bought the house in 2009 for $1.86 million. In October 2017, Kendall picked up a five-bedroom home in Beverly Hills for $8.55 million. A big reason she sold the Hollywood Hills home was due to the fact that it was semi-exposed and she had a number of 911 stalker incidents at the property. The new Beverly Hills home is in the much more secure gated community of Mulholland Estates. Though it should be noted that <a href=# title="Paris Hilton Net Worth">Paris Hilton</a>'s Mulholland home was burglarized FIVE TIMES. Today her next door neighbor is <a href=# title="Christina Aguilera Net Worth">Christina Aguilera</a>.</p><h2 id=other-creative-pursuits><strong>Other Creative Pursuits</strong></h2><p>In addition to modeling, Jenner has ventured behind the camera herself. Her first published work as a photographer was in the sixteenth anniversary issue of LOVE magazine, where she styled and photographed <a href=# title="Kaia Gerber Net Worth">Kaia Gerber</a>, daughter of supermodel <a href=# title="Cindy Crawford Net Worth">Cindy Crawford</a>. Jenner also co-authored the novel "Rebels: City of Indra" (2014) with her sister Kylie and ghostwriter Maya Sloan.</p><h2 id=business-ventures><strong>Business Ventures</strong></h2><p>Together with her younger sister Kylie, as well as her Kardashian family, Jenner has secured several lucrative business deals. In 2011 she created two nail lacquers for the Kardashian Kolors nail polish line by Nicole by OPI, eventually earning a combined profit with Kylie of $100,000. The Jenner sisters' other collaborations include their 2013 "Metal Haven by Kendall & Kylie" jewelry collection with Mascal Mouawad's Glamhouse, their 2014 shoe and handbag line for Nordstrom under <a href=# title="Steve Madden Net Worth">Steve Madden</a>'s Madden Girl line, "The Kendall & Kylie Collection" with PacSun launched in 2013, and the "Kendall + Kylie" Topshop collection launched in 2016. Furthermore, in September 2015 each of the Jenner and Kardashian sisters released a paid subscription mobile app website in collaboration with Whalerock Industries, and in 2016 the Jenner sisters partnered with Glu Mobile to launch the "Kendall and Kylie" app, a spinoff of their older sister Kim's app "<a href=# title="Kim Kardashian Net Worth">Kim Kardashian</a>: Hollywood."</p><h2 id=controversy><strong>Controversy</strong></h2><p>Jenner is no stranger to controversy and public backlash. In January 2017, Jenner was paid $250,000 for an Instagram post promoting the upcoming Fyre Festival. Fyre Festival was actually a fraudulent event, plagued with corruption and inefficiencies, and many criticized Jenner for promoting the event. In April 2017, she starred in a Pepsi commercial titled "Live for Now." The commercial was live for only one day, after it was heavily criticized for trivializing the Black Lives Matter movement and protests against policy brutality.</p><p>In June 2017 she was once again in hot water, when she launched a line of T-shirts with sister Kylie that featured logos or images of famous musicians or bands, including <a href=# title="Tupac Net Worth">Tupac</a> Shakur, The Doors, Metallica, Pink Floyd, and The Notorious B.I.G. Several of the estates of the featured artists filed cease and desist letters, with the photographer whose image of Tupac Shakur was used even suing the sisters for copyright infringement. The sisters took down the shirts and issued a public apology.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Unlike her siblings, Jenner does not publicly disclose details of her love life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7zKibnqSjZLimusOao6Vlmpq7r7HRZqWerF2svLPAx2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkendall-jenner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Kendall%20Jenner%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkendall-jenner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkendall-jenner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kendall%20Jenner%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkendall-jenner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kendall%20Jenner%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkendall-jenner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Kendall%20Jenner%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkendall-jenner-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Kendall%20Jenner%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./ncis-los-angeles-premiere-recap-10-10-21-season-13-episode-1-subject-17.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="NCIS: Los Angeles Premiere Recap 10/10/21: Season 13 Episode 1 Subject 17">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./is-tiktok-shop-legit-and-safe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is TikTok Shop legit and safe?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

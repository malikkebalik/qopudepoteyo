Even despite the public dubbing he’s taken over various personal issues throughout the years, Cruise remains on the Hollywood A-list into his fifth decade of acting. How does he do it?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=275 data-current-count=275 data-injectable=false>The simplest explanation is that he makes quality movies, both as a star and producer of his own films, as well as a savvy chooser of directors. He has worked with Francis Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone, Stanley Kubrick, Brian DePalma, and Michael Mann, among others.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>As we prepare for <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part One</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning – Part Two</a> in 2024, we look back on the running man’s career and answer the question: what are Tom Cruise’s best films to date?</p><h3 id=h-10-top-gun-maverick-2022 data-injectable=false>10. Top Gun: Maverick (2022)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=483 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>Top Gun: Maverick truly showed us the need for speed never goes away, even after 36 years. The long-awaited sequel to the 1986 hit action film managed to not only capture fans of the original, but captivate a new generation as well. Reprising his role as Top Gun graduate Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, Cruise is once again returning to the halls he once walked to teach a new class of recruits, including the son of his deceased best friend Nick “Goose” Bradshaw.</p><p data-characters=367 data-current-count=367 data-injectable=false>Just like Maverick, Cruise shows us that the times may change, but you can’t beat the classics. Not only does Cruise feel right at home back in the iconic leather jacket, but he gives an emotional performance as he faces the ghosts of his past. Plus, who didn’t love seeing Maverick and Iceman (Val Kilmer) working together rather than against each other?</p><h3 id=h-9-jerry-maguire-1996 data-injectable=false>9. Jerry Maguire (1996)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=667 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=488 data-current-count=488 data-injectable=true>Everybody was shouting “Show me the money!” in the wake of this film’s release, not least Cruise himself, after Cameron Crowe’s romantic comedy Jerry Maguire became one of the top-grossing hits of the year. Cruise plays the titular sports agent who suddenly develops a conscience about the cut-throat business, leaving him with slim pickings for clients, the most notable of which is football receiver Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr., who won as Oscar for the role.)</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>The heart of the movie is in the relationships between Jerry and Rod, as well as Jerry and Dorothy (Renee Zellwegger in her breakthough role), the young mother that captures Jerry’s heart and makes him understand what is important in this life. Zellwegger’s line, “You had me at hello,” became just as entrenched in the ’90s zeitgeist as “Show me the money!”</p><h3 id=h-8-the-color-of-money-1986 data-injectable=false>8. <strong>The Color of Money</strong> (1986)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=139 data-current-count=439 data-injectable=true>The sequel to Robert Rossen’s 1961 black and white classic, The Hustler, teams Cruise with Paul Newman, who starred in the original.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=363 data-injectable=false>The Colour of Money again stars Newman as Fast Eddie Felson, a semi-successful businessman who is itching to get back around the juice of the pool hall hustle. When he discovers that Cruise’s character, Vincent, is a prodigy with a cue, he teams up with Vincent’s girlfriend (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio) to see if they can turn the kid into a shark.</p><p data-characters=561 data-current-count=924 data-injectable=true>Martin Scorsese’s one attempt at a conventional Hollywood feature starts out well, then sort of meanders to a conclusion. Once the master and apprentice dynamic between Eddie and Vincent is played out, The Colour of Money loses its sense of direction, not even providing a big showdown at the end. Still, the acting is superb. Cruise, with a shock of big black hair, isn’t afraid to play a callow idiot, and Newman remained one of the most natural and charismatic of movie stars even as he aged, winning his one and only Oscar for his performance.</p><h3 id=h-7-collateral-2004 data-injectable=false>7. <strong>Collateral</strong> (2004)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=680 data-injectable=true>Directed by Michael Mann, Collateral stars Cruise as Vincent, a hit-man with silver hair. Vincent, however, is not one of Cruise’s patented shallow jerks who learns the error of his ways. He’s a bonafide sociopathic assassin who hijacks an L.A. cab and forces the driver, Max (Jamie Foxx), to chauffeur him around L.A. so he can pick off the targets on his hit list.</p><p data-characters=420 data-current-count=420 data-injectable=true>Mann shoots the movie with an early high-definition digital movie camera that give the L.A. nighttime locations an effectively course and unfinished look, and while Collateral is not as thrilling a film as Mann’s L.A. crime opus Heat, it surely has its moments. Still, the heart of Collateral lies not in the action, but the mordant philosophical exchanges between the nihilistic Vincent and the self-deluding Max.</p><h3 id=h-6-minority-report-2002 data-injectable=false>6. Minority Report (2002)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=507 data-current-count=807 data-injectable=true>Cruise’s first collaboration with director Steven Spielberg (their second War of the Worlds would be hampered by Cruise’s famous antics on Oprah’s couch), Minority Report was hailed by critics with its rich story world and scary vision of the future in which a government agency, Pre-Crime, arrests and convicts murderers before they commit any crime. Cruise plays Chief John Anderton, a top Pre-Crime agent who must unravel the conspiracy that has him wrongly accused of a future murder.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>Beautifully shot, staged, and designed by Spielberg and his crew, Minority Report has remained notable for its visionary look at the future, predicting such technological and political developments as domestic wiretapping and personalized advertising.</p><h3 id=h-5-rain-man-1988 data-injectable=false>5. Rain Man (1988)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=552 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=472 data-current-count=472 data-injectable=true>The idea that a two-character road trip drama without any VFX could become the highest grossing movie of 1988 seems incredible now, but Rain Man (directed by Barry Levinson) struck a nerve with audiences. Cruise plays another of his shallow jerks, a rare car dealer who kidnaps his autistic savant brother, Raymond (Dustin Hoffman), and drives him from Cincinnati to Los Angeles in the hopes of leveraging some of the substantial inheritance their father has left Raymond.</p><p data-characters=529 data-current-count=529 data-injectable=true>Dustin Hoffman got all the hype for this movie and deservingly won Best Actor for his convincing performance. Still, the character’s flat, emotionless line delivery and lack of eye contact means that somebody else needed to register all the big emotional beats for the audience, which Cruise does without ever trying to steal the show. Cruie and Hoffman are a great team, and their matchup created some famous moments, such as when Raymond learns how to drive, orders pancakes, and declares that “K-Mart sucks.”</p><h3 id=h-4-edge-of-tomorrow-2014 data-injectable=false>4. Edge of Tomorrow (2014)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=461 data-current-count=761 data-injectable=true>Often described as Groundhog Day with aliens, Edge of Tomorrow stars Cruise as an officer with no combat experience who is forced onto the front lines of a D-Day-style assault against alien invaders entrenched in France. When he accidentally links up with the alien’s time-turning consciousness, he finds that he cannot be killed and must live the same day over and over until he and another soldier (Emily Blunt) can discover a way to conquer the enemy.</p><p data-characters=484 data-current-count=484 data-injectable=true>What could have been derivative and gimmicky is instead exciting and funny, as Edge of Tomorrow delivers inspired variations on a theme. True to form, Cruise is not afraid to play a very flawed character who only slowly learns to become an adequate soldier. Much of the fun comes from his character being endlessly slaughtered and humiliated. The extended climax is not as inventive as the rest of the picture, but overall you can’t ask for much more from a sci-fi action flick.</p><h3 id=h-3-mission-impossible-movies-fallout-2018-rogue-nation-2015-ghost-protocol-2011 data-injectable=false>3. Mission: Impossible movies – Fallout&nbsp;(2018), Rogue Nation (2015), Ghost Protocol (2011)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=602 data-injectable=true>The Mission: Impossible movies are an outlier in franchise filmmaking in that successive installments have tended to get better, not worse, than their predecessors, so that the most recent entry, Fallout, is the best reviewed of the series, with Rogue Nation and Ghost Protocol slotting in just behind.</p><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=393 data-injectable=false>The key to the success of these Mission: Impossible movies is Cruise’s insistence on quality, on staging the best stunts in the industry, and on publicizing his own participation in those stunts. For Ghost Protocol, he famously scaled the world’s tallest building in Dubai. In Rogue Nation, he leapt onto the side of a speeding plane. In Fallout, he did a high altitude halo jump.</p><p data-characters=333 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>The seventh installment of the Mission: Impossible series, Dead Reckoning – Part One, doesn’t come out until next year and already <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the big stunt</a> that has Cruise leaping a motorcycle off a cliff is being publicized. Given the way this series has gone, no one will be surprised if Cruise tops himself again with the finale.</p><h3 id=h-2-born-on-the-fourth-of-july-1989 data-injectable=false>2. Born on the Fourth of July (1989)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=146 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>Cruise’s Oscar-nominated tour-de-force performance as Ron Kovic, the real-life Vietnam veteran turned anti-war activist, remains a stunner.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Cruise had shown that he could act, turning in strong performances in movies such as Rain Man, The Color of Money, and Risky Business, but his raw performance in Born on the Fourth of July as a young man coming to terms with new physical limitations (Kovic was paralyzed from the waste down by a bullet wound in combat), and ideological disillusionment about the United States’ conduct in the war, took his performance skills to a new level.</p><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>Director Oliver Stone had dramatized the hell of combat a few years earlier in Platoon, and so in Born on the Fourth of July he renders a harrowing depiction of the conditions for returning vets, as well as the turmoil that the war created on the homefront. Stone’s passionate filmmaking along with John Williams’ lush score make Born on the Fourth of July a moving experience, and Cruise’s performance at its center remains one for the ages.</p><h3 id=h-1-risky-business-1983 data-injectable=false>1. Risky Business (1983)</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>It’s not always easy to pinpoint the exact moment an actor becomes a star, but with Cruise it was obviously the moment he slid across the floor in his skivvies and a pair of Ray Ban Wayfarers while lip synching to Bob Seger’s “Old Time Rock and Roll” in Risky Business.</p><p data-characters=476 data-current-count=476 data-injectable=true>Cruise plays Joel, a high school senior who is thrilled to have the house to himself while his parents are away. Make no mistake, shenanigans will ensue as Joel has to figure out how to earn enough money to pay for the damage he causes (he drives his father’s Porsche into Lake Michigan, among other things), while also getting himself through a Princeton entrance interview. His solution? Turn the house into a brothel with the help of a sex worker (Rebecca De Mornay)!</p><p data-characters=469 data-current-count=469 data-injectable=false>Beyond it’s setup, Risky Business has little in common with the the cheap party flicks and shallow teen sex comedies that deluged 1980s cinema. Written and directed by Paul Brickman, Risky Business is a thoughtful movie about the treacherous transition into adulthood and a scathing critique of the amorality of capitalism. One of the defining movies of the 1980s, Risky Business remains a touching coming-of-age story and a trenchant satire of Reagan-era values.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomZ6rpGLBsLmMnKmuoaOaeq671aKcrGWfm3qiuMtmq6KllWQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-10-best-tom-cruise-movies-of-all-time-ranked.html&text=The%2010%20best%20Tom%20Cruise%20movies%20of%20all%20time%2c%20ranked&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-10-best-tom-cruise-movies-of-all-time-ranked.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-best-tom-cruise-movies-of-all-time-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Tom%20Cruise%20movies%20of%20all%20time%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-10-best-tom-cruise-movies-of-all-time-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Tom%20Cruise%20movies%20of%20all%20time%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-10-best-tom-cruise-movies-of-all-time-ranked.html&title=The%2010%20best%20Tom%20Cruise%20movies%20of%20all%20time%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-10-best-tom-cruise-movies-of-all-time-ranked.html&description=The%2010%20best%20Tom%20Cruise%20movies%20of%20all%20time%2c%20ranked" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brad-pitt-is-worried-about-introducing-ines-de-ramon-to-his-kids-according-to-source.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brad Pitt Is Worried About Introducing Ines De Ramon to His Kids, According to Source">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ronald-lauder-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ronald Lauder Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

Tariq Trotter, better known by his stage name Black Thought, began performing with Ahmir "<a href=#>Questlove</a>" Thompson in the late 80s. The duo added more musicians and began performing as The Square Roots in college. They subsequently shortened their name to The Roots, and released their first album, "Organix", in 1993. Their second album, "Do You Want Me", became quite popular with alternative music fans, and they began touring the alternative music circuit, including performing at Lollapalooza, the Montreux Jazz Festival, and finally, Woodstock 99. They achieved widespread fame with the release of their album, "Things Fall Apart", and won a Grammy in 2000. They have since released several more successful albums. In addition to his work with The Roots, Tariq Trotter has also appeared in such films as, "Bamboozled" and "Brooklyn Baby", and has also performed with numerous other artists. He is acclaimed for his live performing, complex rhyme schemes, and politically conscious lyrics. With the other members of the Roots, he appears on "The Tonight Show Starring <a href=#>Jimmy Fallon</a>," often playing games with Fallon and the celebrity guests.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Tariq Trotter was born on October 3, 1973 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to Cassandra and Thomas.

They subsequently formed a music duo and performed at talent shows and on the streets of Philadelphia. Trotter then became an MC for the hip hop group the Square Roots, which included his college friend Malik B. Eventually, the Square Roots were renamed the Roots; they went on to independently release their debut album, "Organix," in 1993. Two years after that, the Roots released "Do You Want More?!!!??!" via DGC Records. In 1996, the group had a substantial commercial hit with "Illadelph Halflife," which peaked at number four on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. The album spawned the successful single "What They Do." The next album by the Roots was "Things Fall Apart," which was released in 1999. An even greater hit, it reached number two on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and number four on the Billboard 200, and became the group's first album to sell over 500,000 copies. Moreover, the album earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Rap Album, and won the Grammy for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group for the song "You Got Me."</p><p>In 2002, the Roots released their fifth studio album, "Phrenology." Although it did not repeat the commercial success of "Things Fall Apart," the album was widely acclaimed by critics. The Roots climbed back up the charts with their next album, 2004's "The Tipping Point," which peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. It was followed in 2006 by "Game Theory," a Grammy Award nominee for Best Rap Album. The Roots scored further hits with 2008's "Rising Down" and 2010's "How I Got Over."

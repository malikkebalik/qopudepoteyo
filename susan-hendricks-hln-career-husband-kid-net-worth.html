of them share a bond.</p><p>From a very young age, Hendricks was interested in reporting and wanted to be an anchor.</p><p>Her family members also supported Hendricks in all of her decisions, and there was no looking back.</p><p>In the case of educational background, Susan attended Hun School in Princeton and later completed a bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University.</p><p>For her significance though, Mass communication came through, and the keen interest in being the anchor helped the selection.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Susan always wanted to be an anchor, but the road ahead for the journalist was not so easy.</p><p>She is one of the top-ranked journalists now, but she started low and very early.</p><p>Her career started with Comcast cable in Orange county and moved to places.</p><p>In one of the interviews, Hendricks clarified that she saw Walter Cronkite speak in one of the journalism courses, and her life changed.</p><p>After the initial works, this American

of the stories covered by the anchor for CNN.</p><p>Showing most of the skills in HLN well, she thought it was time to shift.</p><p>The shift from HLN to DIRECT TV is pretty surprising, but the reason is not known.</p><p>Moving from one place to another is her theme, so she returned to HLN again in 2005.</p><p>At this point, though, she is with HLN, and it has almost been two decades.</p><p>Looking

ways.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/tvshowstars.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/susan-117.jpg><p>Following the heartbreak, Hendricks found a man in the same work field with the same goals in life.</p><p><strong>Joe Carter</strong> is the name of the second husband.</p><p>To the unknown readers, he is an anchor

Ant Anstead is best known for presenting the Channel 4 automotive television series "For the Love of Cars" (2014–2015) alongside Philip Glenister. In 2017, Anstead began co-hosting the British TV show "Wheeler Dealers" with <a href=# title="Mike Brewer Net Worth">Mike Brewer</a>, and in 2021, he got his own Discovery+ series, "Celebrity IOU: Joyride." Ant also starred on the 2019 Motor Trend series "Ant Anstead Master Mechanic," and he executive produced the 2022 TV special "Radford Returns." Before starting his television career, Anstead was a Police Constable and a member of the Tactical Firearms Team. He also spent 15 years playing semi-professional football. In 2018, Ant published the books "Cops and Robbers: The Story of the British Police Car" and "Petrol Head Parenting: The Essential Guide to Diagnosing and Nurturing a Petrol Head." He co-founded Radford Motors, a "global luxury coachbuilding brand with British heart & soul."</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Ant Anstead was born Anthony Richard Anstead on March 28, 1979, in Plymouth, Devon, England. Ant grew up in Ely, Cambridgeshire, then his family moved to Hertfordshire when he was 10 years old. Anstead attended Richard Hale School, Hertford, and he completed his A-levels at the Haileybury School.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-284781 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/ant.jpg alt width=900 height=1348 sizes="(max-width: 1002px) 100vw, 1002px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-284781 class=wp-caption-text>Noel Vasquez/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In 1999, 18-year-old Ant joined Hertfordshire Constabulary, becoming a Police Constable stationed at Bishop's Stortford. He later transferred to the Cheshunt police station, where he joined the Tactical Firearms Team in Welwyn Garden City at the age of 23. During an interview with "Influx," Anstead spoke about his time in law enforcement, stating, "I knew I didn't want to go down the education route with University etc, so ended up a copper, and I can honestly say, it's the best decision I have ever made. I loved being in the police. I was there six years, and five years, 11 months and 29 days of that was incredible." He added, "I saw and did things that people would shudder at. I even spent time in a safe-house with the 'railway murderer' John Duffy. It changed everything for me. I received two commendations for bravery and have faced a number of life threatening incidents – really opening my eyes to what humans are capable of. When you're standing in-front of someone armed – that's real fear – it kind of makes standing on stage or in front of a camera easy." Ant resigned in 2005 to build cars full-time, and according to his official website, "Ant started building bespoke classic vehicles to individual client specifications and has an international waiting list exceeding two years." His car builds have earned nine World Records, and he built the biggest Airfix auto model in the world.</p><p>Anstead has his own television production company, Angel 22. From 2014 to 2015, he presented the Channel 4 series "For the Love of Cars," then he was a presenter on "Building Cars Live" (2015), "New York: America's Busiest City" (2016), "Chinese New Year: The Biggest Celebration on Earth" (2016), "Craft: I Made This" (2016), and "The Lost Lotus: Restoring a Race Car" (2016).

That year Anstead also hosted the 12-episode Motor Trend series "Ant Anstead Master Mechanic," which involved him "paying homage to the legendary 1930s Alfa Romeo 158 Grand Prix race car by building his own from the ground up." In 2020, he presented "World's Greatest Cars" on Sky UK, and in 2020, he hosted "Ant Anstead Working from Home" on Motor Trend.

After they split up, Christina put the home on the market in April 2021 for $6 million.</p><p>In June 2021, Ant purchased a three-bedroom, two-bathroom home in Laguna Beach, California. He listed the home for sale for $3.3 million in October 2022, but he took it off the market in early 2023. Anstead told "People" magazine, "I decided to stay. It's a special place." He did eventually sell the special place, accepting $3.1 million in March 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq970aKaoZ2jqXqlsdKinqedoqh8orrTZpinq6SarqV5zZ6rZq%2Bfp8Gpew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fant-anstead-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&text=Ant%20Anstead%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fant-anstead-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fant-anstead-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Ant%20Anstead%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fant-anstead-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Ant%20Anstead%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fant-anstead-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&title=Ant%20Anstead%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fant-anstead-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html&description=Ant%20Anstead%20Net%20Worth%20%7c%20Celebrity%20Net%20Worth" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./barbara-eden-s-net-worth-how-much-money-does-she-make.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barbara Edens Net Worth: How Much Money Does She Make?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./andrew-tate-height-how-tall-is-andrew-tate.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Andrew Tate height: How tall is Andrew Tate?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

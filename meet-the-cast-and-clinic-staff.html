Following veterinarian<a href=#> Dr. Jan Pol</a> as he fulfills his duties to the farmers and pet owners of his rural Michigan community, the series quickly became a hit for the cable channel. And as Dr. Pol will readily agree, his clinic’s success is due to the great team effort of his staff veterinarians and office crew. Here’s the show’s incredible cast and staff.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/The-Incredible-Dr-Pol.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dr-jan-pol>Dr. Jan Pol</h2><p id=par-2_72>In a conversation&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>with AARP</a>, Dr. Pol revealed that what you see is what you get from his family, no matter what producers might want viewers to see. “What you see on the [Nat Geo Wild] show is real family life. In the beginning, a producer wanted me and my son, Charles, to get into a fight for the cameras. I said, ‘I’m not going to do it; our family loves each other.’</p><p id=par-3_44>“My glass is always half full. I think that’s what people are looking for and why the show is so popular. My wife, Diane, and I go to church every Sunday, and we believe in treating others how we would want to be treated.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2 readability=2><p>https://twitter.com/DrPol/status/1435272946835234820</p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-diane-pol>Diane Pol</h2><p id=par-4_36>Dr. Pol in his 2015 memoir Never Turn Your Back on an Angus Cow recalled meeting the love of his life, Diane, who also eventually helped him build his veterinary practice and still runs the office.</p><p id=par-5_56>He described the family with whom he stayed in America as a high school student, particularly their daughter, who was around his age and caught his eye. “I stayed with the Dalrymple family in the small town of Mayville, Michigan,” he wrote. “I was eighteen years old and in the same grade as their daughter, Diane.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3>Left to right: Charles Pol, Diane Pol, and Dr. Jan Pol of ‘The Incredible Dr. Pol’</figure><p id=par-6_65>The teenage Dr. Pol and Diane “quickly became friends. We were very much the same in many ways, but especially in our love of animals. How could anybody not find a woman who played tag with her pet duck attractive? But we liked each other as friends so much, it didn’t even occur to us that maybe we were also falling in love,” he said.</p><p id=par-7_27>The two married in 1967, and thirty years after opening Dr. Pol’s veterinary clinic in 1981 out of their garage, premiered&nbsp;The Incredible Dr. Pol&nbsp;on Nat Geo Wild.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-charles-pol>Charles Pol</h2><p id=par-8_17>If not for Charles, there likely would not be any Incredible Dr. Pol, as his father explained.</p><p id=par-9_109>“What makes all of the wonderful things that have happened to us even more enjoyable is the fact that our success is all Charles’ doing,” Dr. Pol added. “It was his vision. He was the one who believed his father was strange enough that other people would find him entertaining. . . I don’t kid myself . . . The reason our show has been so successful isn’t because of my good looks, my clever jokes, or my sophisticated demeanor. It’s because the whole audience and I share one very important bond: We love and care about animals and want them to be as healthy and pain-free as possible.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4>‘The Incredible Dr. Pol’ creator Charles Pol and daughter Abigail</figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dr-nicole-arcy>Dr. Nicole Arcy</h2><p id=par-10_23>In 2018, Dr. Nicole went to work at Pol Veterinary Services. Before that, she was a huge fan of&nbsp;The Incredible Dr. Pol&nbsp;program.</p><p id=par-11_45>She told Charles in 2020 on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his YouTube show Recheck</a>, “[Dr. Pol] has been a great mentor these past couple of years and he has taught me how to handle different animals, how to treat them, and if I have any questions, he’s right there.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-5><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dr-brenda-grettenberger>Dr. Brenda Grettenberger</h2><p id=par-12_26>A fan favorite on the reality show, Dr. Brenda’s career with Dr. Pol took off, she explained, when she saw an ad in a professional journal.</p><p id=par-13_31>She told&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Monsters and Critics</a>&nbsp;that she began working with the&nbsp;<a href=#>Netherlands-born veterinarian</a>&nbsp;in the 1990s: “I answered a help wanted ad in the AVMA journal (magazine) to find my way to Pol Veterinary Services.”</p><p id=par-14_73>Her&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bio on the Dr. Pol website</a>&nbsp;revealed more about her education and background: “Dr. Brenda Grettenberger was born in Eaton Rapids, Michigan, in 1967.&nbsp;She grew up on a dairy farm and always had an interest in large animals.&nbsp;After graduating from Michigan State University College of Veterinary Medicine in 1992, Dr. Brenda began working at Pol Veterinary Services.&nbsp; When Dr. Brenda is not working, she enjoys dancing, reading, and training her oxen to pull wagons.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-6></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dr-ray-harp>Dr. Ray Harp</h2><p id=par-15_24>For Dr. Ray, who became part of the clinic’s staff in 2019, watching the Nat Geo Wild program led him to Dr. Pol’s door.</p><p id=par-16_76>“Well, when I was deciding whether or not I should go to vet school, we were actually watching Dr. Pol,” Harp told Charles on Recheck. “And my wife said, ‘I think you should just go ahead and apply. That looks like a lot of fun.’ So, that’s how I ended up going to vet school and I graduated. She had been checking the want ads for me and it turned out that Dr. Pol was hiring.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-7><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-dr-lisa-jones>Dr. Lisa Jones</h2><p id=par-17_94>As for Dr. Ray’s fellow 2019 hire Dr. Lisa Jones, she explained to Charles on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>Recheck</a> that “Yeah, all the way up until I went to college, I was home-schooled,” she said. The Cornell University graduate added, “I think [home-schooling] was a very unique experience; we had a lot more flexibility in our schedule. If we had a nice day outside, we could all go out and stare at flowers and identify roots for science class. We were able to go on some pretty cool field trips and see a lot of the country.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-8><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-and-of-course-there-s-tater-the-office-cat>And of course, there’s Tater the office cat</h2><p id=par-18_41>Although it’s not clear who Tater belonged to before becoming Dr. Pol’s forever cat, the story goes that he was brought in after getting caught in an animal trap. His leg was damaged beyond repair, forcing the veterinarian to amputate it.</p><p id=par-19_41>Tater has <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his own Instagram account</a> and generally can be seen sleeping on a desk, a waiting room chair, or splayed out on the waiting room floor.

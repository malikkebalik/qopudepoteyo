Police said Ralph mistook the address 115th Terrace for 115th Street, where he was shot. He was released from the hospital on Sunday after suffering life-threatening injuries, and is now recovering at home, according to <a href=# rel=noopener>local media</a>.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">His mother, Cleo Nagbe, says that Ralph is doing “considerably well,” but says that he is replaying the tragedy “over and over again.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Cleo Nagbe told <a href=#>@GayleKing</a> that her son, 16-year-old Ralph Yarl, is crying "buckets of tears" as he recovers from two gunshot wounds.</p><p>She said Ralph is “replaying the situation over and over again.” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/RkOG34FqtE</a></p>— CBS Mornings (@CBSMornings) <a href=#>April 18, 2023</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Andrew Lester, the 84-year-old white homeowner who shot Ralph, turned himself in Tuesday afternoon at the Clay County Detention Center. He faces felony charges of first-degree assault and armed criminal action for the April 13 shooting. The assault charge carries potential punishment of up to life in prison, while sentences for armed criminal action range from three to 15 years.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lester claimed to police that he opened fire through the door of his home without saying a single word because he was “scared to death” of the unarmed teen. Clay County prosecutor Zachary Thompson said Monday that there appeared to be a “racial component” to the case, but he clarified that the probable cause statement did not indicate that the case was “racially motivated.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to charging documents, Lester told police shortly after he shot Ralph that it was the “last thing he wanted to do,” but says he believed “he was protecting himself against a “physical confrontation,” which he would not have been prepared for given his advanced age. Lester pointed to Ralph’s size, which he claimed was 6 feet, and Lester’s “inability to defend himself” as the reasoning behind his actions. (Ralph’s aunt, Faith Spoonmore, <a href=# rel=noopener>told CNN</a> he is not that tall.)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Protests have erupted in Kansas City and across the nation following the shooting, and the incident has received widespread attention on social media. President Joe Biden spoke to Yarl’s family, the White House <a href=# rel=noopener>confirmed</a> on Monday, offering “his prayers for Ralph’s health and for justice,” according to <a href=# rel=noopener>a statement</a> from the family’s attorneys. Vice President Kamala Harris <a href=# rel=noopener>tweeted</a>: “Let’s be clear: No child should ever live in fear of being shot for ringing the wrong doorbell. Every child deserves to be safe.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The family <a href=# rel=noopener>has launched</a> a GoFundMe which has amassed nearly $3 million so far.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s what we know about the case.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">What happened?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On April 13, Ralph’s family asked him to pick up his younger twin brothers from a friend’s house.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Spoonmore, who identified herself as Yarl’s aunt and has started a<a href=# rel=noopener> GoFundMe</a> page, the homeowner “opened the door, looked my nephew in the eye, and shot him in the head. My nephew fell to the ground, and the man shot him again. Ralph was then able to get up and run to the neighbor’s house, looking for help.” The Kansas City <i>Star</i> <a href=# rel=noopener>reports</a> that Yarl had to ask for help at three different houses before he got the aid he needed.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Officers responded to reports of a shooting and found that Yarl had been wounded. Police said Sunday that he is in a stable condition. “Despite the severity of his injuries and the seriousness of his condition, Ralph is alive and recovering,” said civil rights attorneys S. Lee Merritt and<a href=#> Benjamin Crump</a> in a statement issued on behalf of Yarl’s family. Crump has represented the families of victims in other high-profile shootings, including<a href=#> Trayvon Martin</a>,<a href=#> Breonna Taylor</a>, and<a href=#> George Floyd.</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><b>Read More:</b><a href=#> <i>Inside Ben Crump’s Quest to Raise the Value of Black Life in America</i></a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">According to Spoonmore’s funding page, Ralph plays multiple instruments in the metropolitan youth orchestra and participated in the Missouri Scholars Academy for gifted high school students in 2022. His goal is to attend Texas A&M University to study chemical engineering.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ralph-yarl-kansas-city-shooting.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The prosecutor said Lester, who lived alone, shot Yarl with a .32-caliber revolver through a glass door. No words were exchanged between the two. There were no witnesses or video of the shooting itself.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Excerpts of the prosecutor’s probable cause statement <a href=# rel=noopener>posted online</a> reveal that Lester told police he picked up his gun after hearing the doorbell ring while laying down. He opened an interior door and saw a “black male approximately six feet tall” pulling on the exterior door of his house. Believing it was a break-in attempt, he fired twice after opening the door.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lester said he was “scared to death” because of his inability to defend himself and clarified that shooting was “<a href=# rel=noopener>the last thing he wanted to do</a>,” according to the statement.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Darron Edwards, lead pastor of the United Believers Community Church, says the community is “shocked” by the actions that transpired against Yarl.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The way we are told right now that this has happened, ringing a doorbell and instantly, getting shot two times, is not how you want to look at your city,” Edwards says. “I started thinking about the little kids at Halloween that trick or treat, can they ring the doorbell?”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On Sunday, hundreds of people took to the streets in Kansas City in <a href=# rel=noopener>protest</a>, chanting “justice for Ralph” and “Black lives matter.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Neighbor describes helping Ralph Yarl after shooting</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">James Lynch, the good Samaritan who rushed to aid Ralph, said he heard someone screaming for help in the typically tranquil neighborhood. “I thought he was dead,” Lynch <a href=# rel=noopener>told NBC News</a>. “He hasn’t even begun to live his life yet. He didn’t deserve to get shot.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lynch, who is Lester’s neighbor, was getting ready for bed when he heard the teenager scream that he had been shot. The 42-year-old father of three, had seen Ralph banging on the door of Lester’s home through his kitchen window; he was trying to figure out what was going on next door after he heard shouting.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lynch ran over to the yard, where he found Ralph covered in blood.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lynch and another neighbor tried to stop the bleeding. He asked the teenager his name and age—and Ralph struggled to respond but did spell his name. The duo stayed until paramedics arrived.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“I didn’t do anything but hold a kid’s hand so he wouldn’t feel alone,” Lynch said. “He had just gotten shot twice; he had a hole in the side of his head</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“That kid is tougher than I am.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Why was the shooter released?</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Lester, who at the time remained unnamed, was initially taken into custody and placed on a 24-hour hold while investigations were carried out, Kansas City Police Chief Stacey Graves said in a news conference Sunday. He was later released because charges had not yet been made, Graves confirmed. This sparked concerns among the wider community that there would be no accountability for the shooter.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Prosecutors charged Lester on Monday, and he turned himself in on Tuesday.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It is situations like this that feed the ongoing distrust in law enforcement when Black people are the victims of excessive or deadly force at the hands of white citizens and law enforcement,” Gwen Grant, president and CEO of the Urban League of Greater Kansas City, told the Kansas City <i>Star</i>. “The notion that a victim’s statement is required is unfathomable to me. Homicide victims don’t give statements, yet the perpetrators get arrested.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“This is one [event] you cannot divorce from race,” Edwards says. “The family wants justice.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Police <a href=# rel=noopener>previously said</a> that they were waiting for a formal victim statement and forensic evidence to fill out a case file. Graves also said they were investigating whether the gunman was protected by Missouri’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“stand your ground” law</a>, which allows people to use deadly force if they believe it will protect them from death or “great bodily harm.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But as investigators and Lester’s legal defense look to the self-defense laws that may apply in this case, Sean D. O’Brien, a professor at University of Missouri Kansas City School of Law, tells TIME, “There’s still a reasonableness standard. He has to be able to point to something to say he was in fear of [the] ringing [of] the doorbell, and [Yarl] being Black by itself is not going to cut it.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">—With reporting by Chad de Guzman, Sanya Mansoor, and Armani Syed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamdngHV%2FjqSYp6uRqHqktdOyZKuZnKW1bsXAq6Nmq5ikwW680airnqukqHw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkansas-city-teen-ralph-yarl-traumatized-by-shooting-mother.html&text=Kansas%20City%20Teen%20Ralph%20Yarl%20Traumatized%20by%20Shooting%3a%20Mother&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkansas-city-teen-ralph-yarl-traumatized-by-shooting-mother.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkansas-city-teen-ralph-yarl-traumatized-by-shooting-mother.html&title=Kansas%20City%20Teen%20Ralph%20Yarl%20Traumatized%20by%20Shooting%3a%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkansas-city-teen-ralph-yarl-traumatized-by-shooting-mother.html&title=Kansas%20City%20Teen%20Ralph%20Yarl%20Traumatized%20by%20Shooting%3a%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkansas-city-teen-ralph-yarl-traumatized-by-shooting-mother.html&title=Kansas%20City%20Teen%20Ralph%20Yarl%20Traumatized%20by%20Shooting%3a%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkansas-city-teen-ralph-yarl-traumatized-by-shooting-mother.html&description=Kansas%20City%20Teen%20Ralph%20Yarl%20Traumatized%20by%20Shooting%3a%20Mother" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lashana-lynch-gay-or-straight-partner-boyfriend-ethnicity-and-parents.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Lashana Lynch Gay Or Straight?

As of January 2018, she was one of only two Republicans from the City of New York currently serving in the State Assembly, along with <a href=#>Michael Reilly</a>. Malliotakis is Brooklyn's only Republican lawmaker.</p><p>She was the Republican nominee in New York City's 2017 mayoral election against incumbent Mayor <a href=#>Bill de Blasio</a>.

Malliotakis has been endorsed by the Republican and Conservative Parties.</p><p>On April 25, 2017, she filed as a candidate for Mayor of New York City in the 2017 mayoral election under the Republican Party. She went on to win the Republican nomination unopposed after businessman <a href=#>Paul Massey</a> dropped out in June over money concerns. Although Malliotakis did not win the election, she garnered 70% of the vote in her home borough of Staten Island. On November 7, 2017, Malliotakis lost the mayoral election to Democratic Mayor <a href=#>Bill de Blasio</a>.</p><p>Malliotakis voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election and opposes the sanctuary city status, for undocumented immigrants, of New York City. She opposed giving drivers' licenses to undocumented immigrants. She does not support repealing Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion but has voted against taxpayer funded abortions and against the late term abortion bill passed by New York state. She does not identify as pro-life or pro-choice, saying "it's not black or white, I think there's a lot of things that go into a decision of that magnitude.” After originally opposing same-sex marriage, Malliotakis said she regretted that decision and voted to support adoptions by same-sex parents and to protect estate rights for married same-sex couples.

She successfully brought an Article 78 proceeding in New York State Supreme Court to get the Port Authority to disclose the results of an economic impact study regarding the effect the toll increases had had on business at New York Container Terminal.</p><p>She has fought for relief from the September 2011 toll increase on Port Authority bridges, calling for divestment of costly non-essential real estate holdings and highlighting mismanaged contributions to community organizations.</p><p>In 2010, Malliotakis won the election to represent the 60th District in the New York State Assembly. She defeated two-term Democratic incumbent <a href=#>Janele Hyer-Spencer</a> by a margin of 10 percentage points.</p><p>Malliotakis worked as a community liaison for both former state Sen.

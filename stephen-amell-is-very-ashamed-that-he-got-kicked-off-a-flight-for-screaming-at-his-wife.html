When he was asked to simply stop being so loud and disruptive, he refused and then he was escorted off the plane and his wife just continued on without him. Amell came across as an abusive drunk, even in his tweets denying parts of the story. Now, more than two months later, Amell is speaking out about what happened and how sorry he is.</p><p>Canadian actor Stephen Amell has opened up about the “shame” he feels after a drunken incident on a Delta Airlines flight in June, when he was removed for getting loud during an argument with wife, Cassandra Jean.</p><p>“I mean, maybe I destroyed my entire life, my entire career? So, I think, ultimately, very ashamed of it, trying to make amends for it, specifically with my wife,” he said during an appearance on Tuesday’s episode of the “Inside of You with Michael Rosenbaum” podcast.</p><p>“I had too many drinks, and I had too many drinks in a public place, and I got on a plane. I was pissed off about something else that had nothing to do with Cass, my wife, and I picked a fight. Just picked a fight because I wanted to be loud and upset.” The “Arrow” actor said that in addition to being “too loud” he was probably dropping a few “f-bombs” as he argued with his spouse. Amell admitted that Cassandra didn’t engage in the “argument,” but did warn him that he’d likely be kicked off the plane, which was still at the gate, if he didn’t lower his voice.</p><p>“Honestly, I can’t even remember what I was upset about, which was indicative of two things,” he continued. “Handle your liquor. I had too many drinks, right? And B, it clearly wasn’t important. I was just upset and wanted to be upset and sure enough after [Cass] said this, a guy came by and said, ‘Sir, you have to keep your voice down, please.’</p><p>“I’m actually, frankly, like deeply ashamed of it,” he stated. “I feel like I went the better part of 10 years without being an a–hole in public. I was an a–hole in public.”</p><p>Just 10 minutes after quieting down, he was asked to leave the plane, with Amell assuming another passenger complained about his behavior. “I was focusing. I’m staring out the window. I wasn’t gonna say a word for the next two and a half hours. And [the flight attendant] said, ‘We’ll collect your things. We’ll talk about it at the top of the entranceway. And I went ‘OK.’ But what if I just casually, flippantly, not being in sound mind and body, offer like a quick passive f–k off — and all of a sudden I’m in these bracelets?”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>If Cassandra wasn’t engaging in the “argument,” then it wasn’t an argument. It was Amell being drunk and screaming at her in a public setting. And notice how he emphasizes that this is the first time he was this much of an a–hole IN PUBLIC. I do wonder what he’s like privately and what Cassandra puts up with. I hope she’s okay and I genuinely hope this was an incident which caused him to reflect about his drinking and how he treats his wife. I found it kind of chilling how blase he is about the fact that he “can’t remember” why he was mad, but he knows he decided to take it out on his wife.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/avalon-0626515874.jpg alt="Los Angeles Premiere of STARZ's 'Heels'" width=500 sizes="(max-width: 1100px) 100vw, 1100px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of Avalon Red.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcGtgbX5xe9KtnKmglaOsornEpaOYoaOUw6a%2B2JiYrKCRorKlq9OhmK2XmJqsqLvTmKKim5uasaC7xZ%2BWmpeWobaotNOYnaiqj6iws7HApqCnn4%2BWwaC0yKyWsKGWmnw%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstephen-amell-is-very-ashamed-that-he-got-kicked-off-a-flight-for-screaming-at-his-wife.html&text=Stephen%20Amell%20is%20very%20ashamed%20that%20he%20got%20kicked%20off%20a%20flight%20for%20screaming%20at%20his%20wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstephen-amell-is-very-ashamed-that-he-got-kicked-off-a-flight-for-screaming-at-his-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-amell-is-very-ashamed-that-he-got-kicked-off-a-flight-for-screaming-at-his-wife.html&title=Stephen%20Amell%20is%20very%20ashamed%20that%20he%20got%20kicked%20off%20a%20flight%20for%20screaming%20at%20his%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstephen-amell-is-very-ashamed-that-he-got-kicked-off-a-flight-for-screaming-at-his-wife.html&title=Stephen%20Amell%20is%20very%20ashamed%20that%20he%20got%20kicked%20off%20a%20flight%20for%20screaming%20at%20his%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstephen-amell-is-very-ashamed-that-he-got-kicked-off-a-flight-for-screaming-at-his-wife.html&title=Stephen%20Amell%20is%20very%20ashamed%20that%20he%20got%20kicked%20off%20a%20flight%20for%20screaming%20at%20his%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstephen-amell-is-very-ashamed-that-he-got-kicked-off-a-flight-for-screaming-at-his-wife.html&description=Stephen%20Amell%20is%20very%20ashamed%20that%20he%20got%20kicked%20off%20a%20flight%20for%20screaming%20at%20his%20wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./whitney-cummings-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Whitney Cummings Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./james-tupper-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="James Tupper Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>

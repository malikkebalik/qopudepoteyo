Hillis was in critical condition following the incident that occurred the first week of Jan. 2023, and he was on a ventilator for approximately one week.</p><p data-characters=326 data-current-count=701 data-injectable=true>At the time, Cole said via Instagram that Hillis was on the road to recovery but still had a long road ahead of him. Hillis did not comment on the matter or on his personal condition until earlier this week, when he posted to Twitter to express his gratitude for the outpouring of support and optimism for a complete recovery.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Release from hospital and update</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1360981001.jpg><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=658 data-injectable=true>The 37-year-old Hillis stated that he has been released from the hospital and is in recovery. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ESPN</a>, referencing an emergency services report, two kids and two adults were struggling in the water when a bystander came to help them get out of the water. Upon arrival, paramedics transported two adults to the hospital, including one by helicopter.</p><p data-characters=230 data-current-count=230 data-injectable=false>His uncle, Greg Hillis, posted the first update of the incident on Facebook back on Jan. 5, stating that he was “still in intensive care and having some problems with his kidneys and lungs but the doctors say he is improving.”</p><p data-characters=113 data-current-count=343 data-injectable=false>In a lengthy note posted with the message “Thank you for all your love and prayers,” Hillis wrote on Tuesday:</p><p>“I just want to come on here and thank everyone for all the prayers and love y’all have given me. It’s really made all the difference. I also want to thank my brave sister, mother, sister in law, my kids, and my girlfriend who has saved my life in more ways than one. Thank you to the amazing staff at the hospital. Baptist hospital in Pensacola. Y’all were truly amazing and took such great care of me. You made all the difference in my recovery.”</p><p data-characters=114 data-current-count=114 data-injectable=false>The message continued with Hillis addressing why he had not spoken about his situation in the month that followed.</p><p>“I haven’t taken any interviews on this because I’d like to keep my family out of the public eye because it was a very traumatic time for us. But I did want to come on here and show my appreciation for everyone who helped save my life and for all of your prayers and love and support. I left the hospital with no worries and concerns and should make a 100 percent recovery. I’m a very lucky and blessed man. Yahwek has really blessed me and I am very thankful.”</p><p data-characters=181 data-current-count=181 data-injectable=false>A message on Cole’s Instagram page shows Hillis being released from the hospital around Jan. 21, with Hillis all smiles and surrounded by a crowd including medical personnel.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed aligncenter is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=481 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Angela Cole (@angelacoleofficial)</a></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-playing-career-madden-nfl-and-retirement data-injectable=false>Playing career, Madden NFL, and retirement</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/GettyImages-1132477721.jpg><p data-characters=501 data-current-count=801 data-injectable=true>One of the more unlikely NFL athletes to grace the cover of the extremely popular Madden football game series, Hillis played in the NFL for seven seasons from 2008 to 2014. His most successful season came in 2010 with the Cleveland Browns, when he was sixth in the NFL with 1,654 yards from scrimmage and third in total touchdowns with 13. He rushed for 1,177 yards — 11th most in the league — that season, to combine with 61 receptions for 477 yards, which was a lot for a running back back then.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=278 data-injectable=false>Hillis largely became the cover man for Madden thanks to fan voting, which the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Electronic Arts</a> gaming company introduced for the first time ever in the lead-up to the Madden NFL 12 release, and at the time he was the only Madden cover athlete to have never played in a Pro Bowl.</p><p data-characters=412 data-current-count=690 data-injectable=true>Though he never reached those heights again mostly because of injury — which is not uncommon in the NFL for running backs to only have a one-, two-, or even three-year run of success before falling off — Hillis remained popular among football fans for his brutal running style combined with grace and swiftness in a large body, Hillis was listed as 6 feet, 1 inch tall and 240 pounds during his playing days.</p><p data-characters=423 data-current-count=423 data-injectable=true>Hillis was an underdog as a professional athlete after being drafted in the seventh round — 227th overall — by the Denver Broncos in 2008. He played two seasons for the Broncos before two years with the Cleveland Browns, followed by one season playing for Kansas City, capped by his final two seasons with the New York Giants. He formally retired in 2015 after suffering an on-field brain injury during the 2014 season.</p><p data-characters=126 data-current-count=126 data-injectable=false>Since retiring, Hillis appeared in the 2021 movie The Hunting — a small-town murder mystery — with girlfriend Angela Cole.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZp%2BaqKCau6awjK2mZqiVrsGwuoyhoKWkmah6p7vRppyrZZ6buW68y5qwnqpdoq6lsMSnZKeenGJ%2Bc3nCqK2eql2owaK%2Bjg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-peyton-hillis-former-nfl-player-and-madden-nfl-12-cover-star.html&text=What%20happened%20to%20Peyton%20Hillis%2c%20former%20NFL%20player%20and%20Madden%20NFL%2012%20cover%20star%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhat-happened-to-peyton-hillis-former-nfl-player-and-madden-nfl-12-cover-star.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-peyton-hillis-former-nfl-player-and-madden-nfl-12-cover-star.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Peyton%20Hillis%2c%20former%20NFL%20player%20and%20Madden%20NFL%2012%20cover%20star%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-peyton-hillis-former-nfl-player-and-madden-nfl-12-cover-star.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Peyton%20Hillis%2c%20former%20NFL%20player%20and%20Madden%20NFL%2012%20cover%20star%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-peyton-hillis-former-nfl-player-and-madden-nfl-12-cover-star.html&title=What%20happened%20to%20Peyton%20Hillis%2c%20former%20NFL%20player%20and%20Madden%20NFL%2012%20cover%20star%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhat-happened-to-peyton-hillis-former-nfl-player-and-madden-nfl-12-cover-star.html&description=What%20happened%20to%20Peyton%20Hillis%2c%20former%20NFL%20player%20and%20Madden%20NFL%2012%20cover%20star%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-soren-marvel-unexpected-twists-and-emotional-rollercoasters-in-secret-invasion.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Soren Marvel?

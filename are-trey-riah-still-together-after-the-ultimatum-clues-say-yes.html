After initially navigating a long-distance relationship, both she and their love for one another proved to be the real deal. Riah, 25, moved in with Trey, 29, and they’d been together for two years when they joined the Netflix reality dating experiment. Ready to fully commit to their relationship and get engaged, Trey issued Riah the titular ultimatum, and he popped the question in the finale. Lisa accepted his proposal, and they revealed in this summer’s reunion that they’re still engaged, post-filming.</p><p>Heading into Ultimatum Day, though, one major issue Trey and Riah had been navigating was that their relationship was lacking in the romance department. While she accused him of slacking on date nights, he thought her “sky-high expectations” had been warped by social media. The paper mill area manager said he simply wanted to create a life like his parents, who have been together for more than 30 years, but Riah, a managing server, on the other hand, had never “seen a happy healthy marriage,” and couldn’t be totally certain about their future together.</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Courtesy of Netflix</p></figure><p>Further complicating matters, Trey “caught feelings” for his trial marriage partner, <a href=# class=T3D>Ryann McCracken</a>. “When I think about Trey, we do everything together. I know he makes me happy, I know he makes me smile,” Riah explained in Episode 8. “But he caught feelings for someone else. It’s just super difficult to move past it.” Meanwhile, she also worried he was maybe “holding [her] back a little bit” because she wanted to follow her dreams of moving to the city and going to school.</p><p>Though Trey admitted his and Riah’s main issue was that they “never had an emotional connection,” and he “saw how easy it was” with Ryann, he was still ready to commit in the finale. After the eight-week experiment <a href=# class=T3D>wrapped filming in late 2022</a>, “real life” hit the couple again, and they’re still working through “getting on the same page” about work schedules and other logistics. “But overall, our relationship is like night and day from what it was before the show,” Trey revealed on the Season 2 reunion.</p><p>In fact, they are “thinking about a destination wedding” in spring 2025. “It’s gonna get here fast, before you know it,” Riah told co-hosts Nick and Vanessa Lachey, adding that she feels like she’s “in a new relationship” with Trey and wants to have a baby in the future. “I said I wanted a nice wedding. I want a gold wedding. I want it to be perfect.”</p><figure class="Qf5 E1M"><p>Courtesy of Netflix</p></figure><p>Prior to the reveal, they’d already offered a major clue that they were still together, post-filming.<strong> </strong>Though they largely remained off of social media during that time, Trey and Riah might have accidentally spoiled their relationship status as recently as July. That’s when the one-time Hooters waitress traveled to Tampa, Florida, to <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>celebrate her 25th birthday</a>. “Cheers to Chapter 25 . . . I can’t wait to see what this year has to offer,” she wrote on July 17. Likely not-so-coincidentally, Trey also posted a series of <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>photos from a Tampa vacation</a> just one day earlier. “Sometimes you have to take time to celebrate where you are in life,” he captioned his post.</p><p>Otherwise, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Riah’s Instagram bio</a> seems to indicate she’s attending the University of South Carolina and living in Charleston. She also lists that the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>MMG modeling agency represents her</a> and links to NyLuxx Hair, a line of custom ready-to-wear glueless wigs. For his part, Trey, who’s still <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>living and working in Georgetown, South Carolina</a>, per his LinkedIn, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>tellingly predicted in March</a> that “Year 29 is going to be an amazing one” for him. Now, all signs seem to point to that being because he and Riah have a wedding to plan.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Aug. 24, 2023</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCxza2cq6yRnruusc2tZq2glWLCrcDIppitrZ1iwbOx2GaZq62eqLyvedGimKFlnpq5tLvNZquon5Wptaa%2BjK2mnZmpYsCmrdKopWZq</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fare-trey-riah-still-together-after-the-ultimatum-clues-say-yes.html&text=Are%20Trey%20%26amp%3b%20Riah%20Still%20Together%20After%20%27The%20Ultimatum%27%3f%20Clues%20Say%20Yes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fare-trey-riah-still-together-after-the-ultimatum-clues-say-yes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fare-trey-riah-still-together-after-the-ultimatum-clues-say-yes.html&title=Are%20Trey%20%26amp%3b%20Riah%20Still%20Together%20After%20%27The%20Ultimatum%27%3f%20Clues%20Say%20Yes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fare-trey-riah-still-together-after-the-ultimatum-clues-say-yes.html&title=Are%20Trey%20%26amp%3b%20Riah%20Still%20Together%20After%20%27The%20Ultimatum%27%3f%20Clues%20Say%20Yes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fare-trey-riah-still-together-after-the-ultimatum-clues-say-yes.html&title=Are%20Trey%20%26amp%3b%20Riah%20Still%20Together%20After%20%27The%20Ultimatum%27%3f%20Clues%20Say%20Yes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fare-trey-riah-still-together-after-the-ultimatum-clues-say-yes.html&description=Are%20Trey%20%26amp%3b%20Riah%20Still%20Together%20After%20%27The%20Ultimatum%27%3f%20Clues%20Say%20Yes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./benny-urquidez-net-worth-celebrity-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Benny Urquidez Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-anna-osceola-meet-jon-hamm-s-new-bride.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Anna Osceola?

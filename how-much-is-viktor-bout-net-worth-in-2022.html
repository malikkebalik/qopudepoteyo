In the late 1980s, Viktor Bout was serving in the Soviet military mission in Mozambique as a translator from Portuguese. There, he met the woman who would become his wife.</p><p>Alla’s second marriage was her second attempt at matrimony. Introducing Elizaveta, the daughter born in 1994 in the UAE. Sergey Anatolyevich Bout, the older brother and former business partner is still active in the legitimate aviation industry in the United Arab Emirates especially in Sharjah and Bulgaria.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Viktor-Bout-Net-Worth-4.jpg><p>In both his personal and professional life, Viktor Bout chooses vegetarianism.

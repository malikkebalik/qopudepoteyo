He announced in a December 2022 Instagram post that he is a University of Alabama at Birmingham first-generation graduate.</p><p>Thomar captioned a picture of himself in his cap and gown. “Let your dreams be bigger than your fears, your actions louder than your words, and your faith stronger than your feelings.”</p><p><strong>Apart from this news if you are interested in the partners of your favorite celebrities you can read our below posts:</strong></p><h2><strong>How did Thomar Latrell Simmons React to Carlee Russell’s Missing?</strong></h2><p><strong>Russell went missing on July 13, 2023</strong>. The police said at approximately 9:34 PM the Hoover 911 Center received a call from a 25-year-old female on I-459 South near mile marker 11 who reported she saw a toddler walking on the side of the interstate.</p><p>Before the police came she called a relative and stopped to see how the youngster was doing, but the family lost touch with Russell. The phone line was still active, though.</p><p>The woman’s mother, Talitha Russell told Alabama Local that her daughter was speaking on the phone with her brother’s girlfriend when the latter reported hearing screaming.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Carlee-Russells-Missing.jpg><p>She said:</p><p>“My son’s girlfriend heard her asking the child, ‘Are you okay?’ She never heard the child say anything but then she heard our daughter scream From there all you hear on her phone is background noise from the interstate.”</p><p>When Russell’s abandoned car and some of her things were discovered, police claimed they were unable to find Russell or the child and had not received any reports of a missing young child.</p><p>A trucker claimed to have seen Russell’s car with the door open while a gray car apparently pulled up next to it about the time she purportedly vanished, according to Russell’s mother, who also spoke to Alabama Local.</p><p>Russell’s mother wrote on Facebook at the time, “Friends and family, whatever city or state you’re in I would like to have someone spearhead search parties.”</p><p>A “single witness” claimed in a prior release to have “possibly” observed a “gray vehicle with a light-complected male standing outside of Carlee’s vehicle.”</p><p>But after two days of the incident, she returned home at 10:45 p.m. local time on Saturday, July 15, 2023. The Police Department shared the full details in a Facebook post (provided below).</p><p>Police responded to the scene to investigate the latest development in the case and said in a statement that she had returned home.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Carlee Russell located <a href=# rel=noopener>#hooverpd</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/10Av7B6x8j</a></p><p>— Hoover Police Dept (@HooverPD) <a href=# rel=noopener>July 16, 2023</a></p><p>Although there isn’t much information on Carlee and Thomar’s connection. <strong>Some people who were interested in the case thought that Thomar might have been responsible for her disappearance. </strong>Simmons started his post with some images and videos of him and Russell together. He said:</p><p>“I don’t even know how to start off this post but to only say thank you to my lord & savior Jesus Christ for saving my girlfriend’s life!”&nbsp;</p><p>He said that he was grateful to everyone who shared pictures on social media and assisted in finding his partner, saying,</p><p>I have been going nonstop since I received the call that she was missing on Thursday night. I know she would’ve done the same for me, so I wasn’t going to give up until I saw her face again!”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Huw-Edwards-Children-2-3.jpg alt="Carlee Russell's Boyfriend: What did He Say About His Girlfriend's Missing?" width=1200 height=675 title="Carlee Russell's Boyfriend: What did He Say About His Girlfriend's Missing?" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Simmons continued:</p><p>“I was straight tunnel vision, even when I would get on social media on my downtime & see some of the false allegations & assumptions about me having something to do with her abduction would have me discouraged at times, but I didn’t give up & kept my faith!”</p><p>He continued by requesting that everyone be respectful of Carlee’s situation saying:</p><p>“She was literally fighting for her life for 48 hours, so until she’s physically & mentally stable again she is not able to give any updates or whereabouts on her kidnapper at this very moment.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Huw-Edwards-Children-3.jpg alt="Carlee Russell's Boyfriend: What did He Say About His Girlfriend's Missing?" width=1200 height=675 title="Carlee Russell's Boyfriend: What did He Say About His Girlfriend's Missing?" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Simmons added:</p><p>“I also want to thank the people on social media who have been understanding & respectful about what she’s been through in these past few days.

God bless you all.”</p><p>As of yet this much is known about this case when we get the latest update we will share it with you.

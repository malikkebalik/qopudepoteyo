But even one of the most prolific <a href=#>rappers</a> in Hip-Hop would do certain things differently if he could. One of those things includes getting an education.

Not only did Lamar finish high school, but he did so at the top of his game with an overall 4.0 GPA. Dr. Dre, who signed Lamar to <a href=#>his Aftermath label</a>, also went to Centennial High.</p><p id=par-4_34>The Humble artist has always held education in high regard. He played principal for a day in Mount Pleasant High school in Rhode Island. There, he reminded the students about the value of education.</p><p id=par-5_60>“Without education, you don’t have anything,” Lamar once told the high school according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rap-Up.com</a>. “My teachers were great positive influences in my life. My middle school English teacher was probably the reason I became a rapper. He used to encourage me to write poetry and would challenge me, which helped me improve my vocabulary and made me enjoy writing.”</p><h2 id=h-kendrick-lamar-once-helped-students-understand-toni-morrison>Kendrick Lamar once helped students understand Toni Morrison</h2><p id=par-6_61>In 2015, <a href=#>Lamar tried to inspire</a> students himself when he visited High Tech High school in New Jersey. High school teacher Brian Mooney used Lamar’s music to help his students understand a Toni Morrison novel. Mooney compared Lamar’s album, To <a href=#>Pimp a Butterfly</a>, with the Morrison novel The Bluest Eye. This helped students engage with Morrison’s novel on a deeper level.</p><p id=par-7_22><a href=#>When Lamar got wind</a> of this, the rapper’s manager contacted the teacher and asked if Lamar could visit Mr. Mooney’s class personally.</p><p id=par-8_32>“I was feeling incredibly grateful and humbled that my work received that much exposure and reached that wide of an audience that Kendrick himself read it,” Mooney told the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a>.</p><p id=par-9_17>Lamar visited the high school and proceeded to bond with both the teacher and the students present.</p><p id=par-10_41>“When I talk to kids, I’m really listening,” Lamar said. “When I do that, we have a little bit of a bigger connection than me being Kendrick and you being a student. It’s almost like we’re friends. Because a friend listens.”</p><h2 id=h-kendrick-lamar-s-biggest-regret-is-not-going-to-college>Kendrick Lamar’s biggest regret is not going to college</h2><p id=par-11_16>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">FUSE</a>, Kendrick Lamar opens up about wishing he’d realized the college experience.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-12_52>“Not experiencing college, at least for a semester, that was my biggest regret, doing it while I was in my teens,” Lamar said. “Now, all these years have passed, I done got deep into a musical career, it’s gonna be hard to find time unless I really put my focus into it.”</p><p id=par-13_12>In a 2015 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a> interview, Lamar echoed these regrets about college.</p><p id=par-14_34>“I could have went.
